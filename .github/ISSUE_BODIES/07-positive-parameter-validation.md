## Objective

After the analytic hypotheses are frozen, rigorously verify one nonempty
positive-parameter box for each claim-bearing model theorem that requires
quantitative margins.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] The relevant analytic result, [#1](https://github.com/h-lu/rfsn-ii-positive-parameter-pde/issues/1)
      or [#6](https://github.com/h-lu/rfsn-ii-positive-parameter-pde/issues/6),
      has fixed hypotheses and conclusion.
- [ ] The analytic proposition and every observable have fixed definitions.
- [ ] The parameter box was selected before the first claim-bearing run.
- [ ] The required signs, inclusions, transversality constants, and first-hit
      margins are enumerated.

## Validation obligations

- [ ] Outward-rounded interval implementation
- [ ] Source-only rebuild from a clean commit
- [ ] Complete dependency and rounding-mode manifest
- [ ] Machine-readable certificates and top-level report
- [ ] Hash binding among source, report, manuscript, and certificates
- [ ] Independent-machine replay before publication

## Outcome

Record `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `INCONCLUSIVE`.  This issue is deliberately deferred
until the analytic theorem contract is stable; computation must not choose the
theorem after seeing the output.
